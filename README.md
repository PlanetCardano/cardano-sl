## Run a Cardano settlement layer node
Run a very lean Cardano settlement node. This is an alternative to having to [do it yourself](https://github.com/input-output-hk/cardano-sl/blob/master/docs/how-to/build-cardano-sl-and-daedalus-from-source-code.md). We've worked hard to make this as simple as possible, so that it is the most stable, easily deployed and smallest footprint of a Cardano node we could manage.

## Usage
#### Pre Requisites
If you're running an Ubuntu box, you can use [this script](https://gist.github.com/EdwardPrentice/1bb589c50260cf030aaed95d3e5fdaa6) to set up a suitable Docker environment. Either way, you'll need Docker installed.

#### Run the container
```
# First, set up some directories we'll use as our volumes
# You're free to change these, just be sure to change the commands below
sudo mkdir -p /cardano/state-wallet-mainnet && sudo chmod -R 777 /cardano/state-wallet-mainnet

docker pull planetcardano/cardano-sl
docker run -d -v /cardano/state-wallet-mainnet:/home/cardano/cardano-sl/state-wallet-mainnet -p "8090:8090" planetcardano/cardano-sl:1.1.1-2
curl -sfk https://localhost:8090/api/settings/sync/progress
```

Full source code, including an example [docker-compose.yml](https://github.com/PlanetCardano/cardano-sl/blob/master/docker-compose.yml) are available on our [Github](https://github.com/planetcardano). This version of the container supports a beta release of the v1 API, which is [documented here](https://cardanodocs.com/technical/wallet/api/v1).

We want this image to be as simple as possible, so removing complexity is important to us. So is version pinning everything.
